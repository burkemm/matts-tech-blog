**What's the result of my work for this app?** <BR />
I created an app that allows someone to create an account and make new blog posts. They can post about any subject or topic. They simply
make an account and then create the blog posts they desire. The user can also delete the same post if they choose to do so.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned how handlebars work in an environment. They can be tricky to manipulate, but they give a great presentation if you know what you're 
doing. I learned how to integrate sequelize and express with handlebars as well.
